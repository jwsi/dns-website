			<h2>Fast</h2>
			<p>UH DNS was engineered for speed from the ground up. It is built upon the fibre backbone of some of the largest data centres in the world. Low latency connections coupled with our efficient distributed record database ensures that DNS queries are answered as fast as possible. No more waiting for zone transfers and propagation; our authoritative servers update instantly.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Scalable</h2>
			<p>Scalability is at the heart of UH DNS. Unlike traditional DNS servers which rely on horizontally scaled servers or zone transfers between multiple servers. Our service utilises a scalable distributed record database. Load balancers automatically distribute your domain's DNS requests to active servers which are created and destroyed based on demand.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Open Source</h2>
			<p>At Ultra Horizon, we believe in the open source software model. We want our customers to be able to verify that their records are hosted, queried and answered as we say. Furthermore, we want to provide you with a service that you can depend on. If a new feature is desired or a bug is found you can submit it straight to us. <br>
